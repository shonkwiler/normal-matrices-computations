# Geometry of Normal Matrices #

The purpose of this repository is to disseminate the numerical experiments reported in the following paper:

* Tom Needham and Clayton Shonkwiler. Geometry of normal matrices. Preprint, 2024. [arXiv: 2405.06190 [math.DG]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06190).

The numerical experiments are performed in the [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) notebook [`DistanceComparisons.nb`](DistanceComparisons.nb). If you do not have Mathematica installed, this can be opened (but not evaluated) with the free [Wolfram Player](https://www.wolfram.com/player/).

This work was supported by the National Science Foundation ([DMS–2107808](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2107808) and [DMS–2107700](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2107700)).
